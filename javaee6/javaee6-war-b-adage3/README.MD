adages3 introduces the JAX-WS API for RESTful services.

- The service can be deployed as usual with the Ant script.
- However, the source code includes Publisher.java, which is a command-line publisher for convenience. It can also be published with Endpoint.

The source also includes Client.java, which can be used to test that the deployed application is working.

/**
 * 
 * JAX-RS, Restlet, and the JAX-WS @WebServiceProviderframeworks for RESTful
 * serv‚Äê ices include client-side APIs. These APIs are meant to simplify the
 * task of writing RESTful clients in general, not just clients against a
 * RESTful service implemented in a particular framework.
 * 
 * To underscore the point, this section takes a look at the JAX-RS client-side
 * API (see Example 3-18); the client, however, goes against the servlet-based
 * predictions2RESTful service from Chapter 2.
